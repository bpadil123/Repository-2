  <p>Hello World! I am a 26 year old young professional who is at the first few steps of my long journey of developing.</p>
  <p>I just learned all about Git and the benefits of using it in my career. This is probably the 5th HTML page I have made
    so far. HTML is so far my favorite because it is definately the most practical thing I've learned so far.</p>
